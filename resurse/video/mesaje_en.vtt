Hello, good people!

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:06.680
Today I will talk to you about the mistakes that
people make them when they plan

00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:12.405
the kitchen and kitchen furniture are
information not found on YouTube

00:00:12.434 --> 00:00:17.625
or on Google, so stay until the end
if you want to have a kitchen of grade 10.

00:00:17.995 --> 00:00:21.555
I'm Constantin Barbu and I'm 18
years in the field of production of

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:25.395
furniture, of which 6 years a
worked as a furniture fitter.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.440
During all this period I entered
in many, many homes and

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.880
I decided to share with you in
this tutorial errors most often

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.090
encountered that I observed
throughout this period.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.580
So let's get started.

00:00:43.605 --> 00:00:47.925
A very common mistake I have
noticed that there is a lack of this space

00:00:47.925 --> 00:00:49.845
of work between the sink and the hob.

00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:55.065
A natural order would be this first
the sink where we wash the food.

00:00:55.065 --> 00:00:58.724
Then this workspace of
minimum 600 millimeters, in which.

00:00:58.945 --> 00:01:04.105
We cut and shred food and
the third is the preparation area

00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:08.335
thermal, respectively the stove, where
the vegetables arrive to be cooked.

00:01:08.605 --> 00:01:09.985
What do I want to emphasize here?

00:01:09.985 --> 00:01:13.465
Always take one of each
calculated to keep this

00:01:13.465 --> 00:01:15.745
space between sink and hob.

00:01:20.915 --> 00:01:26.315
The presence of this is also very important
drawer dedicated specifically to cutlery.

00:01:26.555 --> 00:01:29.375
Equally important
it's also his positioning.

00:01:29.405 --> 00:01:35.465
Ideally it should be present in
close proximity to the work area

00:01:35.465 --> 00:01:38.105
of this active area of the kitchen.

00:01:38.195 --> 00:01:43.565
I would personally equip all the kitchens
just with drawers and I would give up then.

00:01:43.865 --> 00:01:45.605
I'll show you why right away.

00:01:46.244 --> 00:01:50.115
Suppose we have an object
which is stored on the shelf of

00:01:50.115 --> 00:01:52.535
down at the back of it.

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:56.595
It will be very difficult to reach him
where he will have his take.

00:01:56.595 --> 00:01:59.955
It is simply cut
and don't open the drawer.

00:02:00.225 --> 00:02:04.335
For a long time I would get an object of
which I would also need to feel.

00:02:04.785 --> 00:02:09.345
The more the kitchen is thought out
well and more correctly equipped, as well

00:02:09.675 --> 00:02:12.675
cooking will become a greater pleasure.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:23.570
I also noticed the lack of this riser
of the top, which has as its purpose the formation

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:30.020
a barrier against water penetration,
but also of food scraps through

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.210
the space formed between the tiles and the countertop.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.800
So with this fitted
uplifter, let's get rid of this one

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.460
problem that, over time, can
cause a lot of trouble.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.650
At the same time, the presence of this

00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:49.054
Elevator provides the kitchen
a neat aesthetic appearance.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.220
In the same category include
and the plinth that is used at

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.750
the level of the kitchen legs.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.990
This, like the riser, has
has a protective role against water,

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.290
but also food scraps.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.630
An advantage would be that this can be done
remove whenever we want to

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.170
we clean under the furniture bodies.

00:03:21.565 --> 00:03:27.055
If the kitchen space forces you to
you position the table so that you pass

00:03:27.055 --> 00:03:32.215
very often by her side, I suggest
to apply this rounding method

00:03:32.215 --> 00:03:37.945
cultures, which will save you both
you and your family members

00:03:37.945 --> 00:03:40.795
of many unwanted accidents.

00:03:45.734 --> 00:03:48.674
Usually when it comes to
furniture assembly, room

00:03:48.674 --> 00:03:50.115
that is completed.

00:03:50.115 --> 00:03:54.465
From the point of view of arrangement
interior has finished walls, sockets

00:03:54.465 --> 00:03:56.505
fixed, the parquet, the tiles are laid.

00:03:56.685 --> 00:04:00.945
That's why I think it's very
important to place as correctly as possible

00:04:00.945 --> 00:04:05.295
every detail in that room
to enjoy the furniture and

00:04:05.295 --> 00:04:07.454
space as generous and optimized as possible.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.460
